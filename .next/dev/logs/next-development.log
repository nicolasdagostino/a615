[00:00:05.096] Browser ERROR   uncaughtError: Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

Error: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
    We couldn't find the Next.js package (next/package.json) from the project directory: /Users/nicolasdagostino/Desktop/Proyecto/A615/src/app
     To fix this, set turbopack.root in your Next.js config, or ensure the Next.js package is resolvable from this directory.
    Note: For security and performance reasons, files outside of the project directory will not be compiled.
    See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
